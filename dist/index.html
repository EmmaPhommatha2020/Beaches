    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <p>
      Not all beaches are created equal -- as anyone who’s ever fought traffic, stalked people for parking, endlessly searched
      for a spot not occupied by tourists or trash, and then tolerated whichever aspiring DJ decided to set up camp 20 feet
      away, can attest. But with the right scenery... and the right shoreline... and the right conditions, whatever hassles
      and headaches it took to get you to that idyllic stretch of sand cease to matter. Some beaches are near mystical in
      their powers to slow time, erase reality, and hook you into a force greater than yourself. Here are 10 of the world’s
      most beautiful beaches: Whether you’re into majestic cliffs and rock formations or smooth, wide nothingness, sugary
      white sand or pink or black or golden, they’re all perfect no matter how tough the journey.

    <h2>Anse Source d'Argent</h2>
    <p>La Digue, Republic of Seychelles</p>
    <p>
      Its towering cliffs and pink sand make it one of the most photographed beaches in the world. La Digue, specifically its Veuve
      Nature Reserve, is the last place on earth where you can find the rare black paradise flycatcher bird, of which there
      are only about 100 left.

    <p>Ko Phi Phi, Thailand</p>
    <p>
      There’s a reason this plush tropical beach was used as the backdrop for the cult movie The Beach, and that reason is probably
      that they wanted one of the world's most gorgeous tropical beaches in the film. Or, it could just be cheaper to shoot
      a movie in Thailand. Once you get there you might be tempted to make it a full-time vacation; Ko Phi Phi is one of
      the world's most best beach cities where you can live comfortably for dirt cheap.
